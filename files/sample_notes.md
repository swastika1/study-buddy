# Study Notes - Biology Chapter 1

## Introduction to Cell Biology

Cell biology is the study of cell structure and function, and it revolves around the concept that the cell is the fundamental unit of life.

### Key Concepts

1. **Cell Theory**
   - All living organisms are composed of cells
   - The cell is the basic unit of life
   - Cells arise from pre-existing cells

2. **Types of Cells**
   - **Prokaryotic cells**: No nucleus (bacteria)
   - **Eukaryotic cells**: Have nucleus (animals, plants)

3. **Cell Organelles**
   - Nucleus: Contains genetic material
   - Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell
   - Ribosomes: Protein synthesis
   - Endoplasmic Reticulum: Protein and lipid synthesis

## Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose into ATP (energy).

**Formula:** 
```
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP
```

### Stages
1. Glycolysis (cytoplasm)
2. Krebs Cycle (mitochondria)
3. Electron Transport Chain (mitochondria)

## Photosynthesis

Process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

**Formula:**
```
6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2
```

### Key Points
- Occurs in chloroplasts
- Requires chlorophyll (green pigment)
- Produces oxygen as byproduct
- Essential for life on Earth

## Review Questions

1. What are the three parts of cell theory?
2. What is the function of mitochondria?
3. Compare cellular respiration and photosynthesis
4. List 5 organelles and their functions
