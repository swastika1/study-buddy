Quick Chemistry Facts

Chemical Bonding:
- Ionic bonds: Transfer of electrons (NaCl)
- Covalent bonds: Sharing of electrons (H2O)
- Metallic bonds: Sea of electrons (metals)

Periodic Table Trends:
- Atomic radius increases down a group
- Electronegativity increases across a period
- Ionization energy increases across a period

Common Reactions:
- Synthesis: A + B → AB
- Decomposition: AB → A + B
- Single replacement: A + BC → AC + B
- Double replacement: AB + CD → AD + CB

Important Constants:
- Avogadro's number: 6.022 × 10²³
- Gas constant R: 8.314 J/(mol·K)
- Speed of light: 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s

Study tip: Use mnemonic "LEO says GER" 
(Loss of Electrons is Oxidation, Gain of Electrons is Reduction)
